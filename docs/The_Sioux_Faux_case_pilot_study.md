# Pilot Study: The Sioux-Faux Scenario

For this pilot study, you are asked to optimize the transportation network for a *sample of citizens* from a mock city: Sioux-Faux. The cityâ€™s 157,000 citizens travel between activities using either their personal automobiles, buses provided via a public transit system, taxis enabled via an on-demand ridehail company, active modes such as walking, or a combination of multiple modes in accordance with their preferences. Utilizing the constrained transportation budget of Sioux-Faux,*(Note to organizers: TBD)* and a limited number of attempts, you will compete with other contestants to produce the best transportation outcomes as computed by the [scoring function](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md).

## Sioux-Faux network
The Sioux-Faux road network is shown below (Fig. 1). Currently, the Sioux Faux Bus Lines (SFBL) transportation company operates twelve bus lines in the city.

## Sioux-Faux sample population
For the Pilot Study, you have access to two sample populations with which you can run simulations:
* a 1,000 (1k) individuals sample
* a 15,000 (15k) individuals sample

It is permissible to use either sample to develop your algorithm. For example, you can develop your algorithm using the 1k scenario You can then test it with the 15K population scenario. Note that submissions must be run with the 15K sample population.
