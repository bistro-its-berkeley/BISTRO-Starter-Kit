# A quick introduction to the Transportatino Optimization Problem



## What is BEAM?

## What are the inputs of BEAM?

(combination of inputs on public transit operations and public transit financial aspects)


## What are the outputs of BEAM? 

Once all agents of the system have chosen their optimal transportation modes to attend their daily activities, the system reaches what we call an *equilibrium state*. The quality of the policy-based transportation system can then be evaluated based on the system performance: how much 

## What  

The Uber Prize optimization problem consists of developping an optimization algorithm to find the best policy, i.e. the policy aspects that will optimize the transportation system
