# How to submit?

Once you have found your best input-combination send the following documents to sid.feygin@berkeley.edu:

* A **zip. version of your best output folder** 
* A **brief explanation on your methodology** (.doc): how did you solve the optimization problem, what did you try, is there some room for improvement?

Feel free also to **submit pull requests** on this documentation repository if you see any unclear information or have any suggestions for improvements.

Thank you! :-)
