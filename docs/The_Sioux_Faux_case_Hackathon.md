# The Sioux-Faux case - Hackathon

For the Hackathon phase of the Uber Prize, you are challenged to optimize the transportation network of a mock city: Sioux Faux. The cityâ€™s 157,000 citizens travel between activities using either their personal automobiles, buses provided via a public transit system or taxis enabled via an on-demand ridehail company, active modes such as walking, or a combination of multiple modes in accordance with their preferences. Utilizing the constrained transportation budget of Sioux Faux, and a limited number of attempts, you will compete with other contestants to produce the best outcomes given the trade-offs between the metrics defined above.

## Sioux-Faux network
You can find the Sioux-Faux road network below (Fig. 1). Currently, the Sioux Faux Bus Lines (SFBL) transportation company  operates twelve bus lines in the city.

## Sioux-Faux sample population
For the Hackathon, you have access to two sample populations with which you can run simulations: one with 1K individuals and the other one with 15K individuals. We advise you to first use the 1K sample to developp your algorithm due to the shorter running times of the simulations. You can then test it with the 15K population scenario. Note that you submission solution must be runned with the 15K sample population.
