# The Sioux-Faux case - Hackathon


For the first phase of the Uber Prize, you are challenged to optimize the transportation network of a mock city: Sioux Faux. The cityâ€™s 157,000 citizens travel between activities using either their personal automobiles, buses provided via a public transit system or taxis enabled via an on-demand ridehail company, active modes such as walking and bicyling, or a combination of multiple modes in accordance with their preferences. Utilizing the constrained transportation budget of Sioux Faux, and a limited number of attempts, contestants will compete to produce the best outcomes given the trade-offs between the metrics defined above.
