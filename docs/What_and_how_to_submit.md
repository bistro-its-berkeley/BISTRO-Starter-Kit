# How to Submit Solutions?

Once you have found your best set of inputs, please send the following documents in an archive to sfeygi@ext.uber.com:

* An archive of your best input folder
* An archive of the output folder corresponding to your best input
* A brief (1-2 page) write-up (with figures/tables, if desired) of your methodology. In this document, please answer the following questions:
    - how did you solve the optimization problem?
    - what worked in general and what led to a dead end?
    - what other approaches would you have pursued, had you more time?
    - did you run into any snags with the documentation/implementation?
