To be able to optimize the transportation system of Sious Faux, you will need to test some different input-policies  by running an agent-based simulation with the BEAM simulator. This Technical Starter Kit gives you the steps for installing BEAM and understanding where the inputs and outputs of the simulation are stored.

# Installing BEAM

Clone the following GitHub repository in your GitHub Desktop:
https://github.com/sfwatergit/BeamCompetitions

After you unzip the archive, you will see a directory that looks like this when partially expanded:

# Overview of the repository

The repository contains all required inputs to run the simulation for Sioux Faux with BEAM. You will only have control on a few of them but let’s quickly describe all of them. 

## Overview of the fixed inputs 

The folder *fixed-data/siouxfalls* encloses, for each Sioux Faux scenario, all fixed inputs necessary for one instance of the simulation. They describe the configuration of the simulation parameters, the configuration of the transportation network, the agents’ desired activity plans and attributes, the households’ attributes and the vehicles characteristics.

You will not have to change these parameters.
