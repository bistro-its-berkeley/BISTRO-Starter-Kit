# The Sioux Faux Benchmark Scenario

In the Sioux Faux Benchmark Scenario, you may optimize the transportation network for a *sample of citizens* from a mock city: Sioux Faux. The city’s 157,000 citizens travel between activities using either their personal automobiles, buses provided via a public transit system, taxis enabled via an on-demand carsharing company, active modes such as walking, or a combination of multiple modes in accordance with their preferences. You will compete with other contestants to produce the best transportation outcomes as computed by the [scoring function](./Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md).

## Sioux Faux sample population

In order to simulate the activity and travel behavior of the citizens of Sioux Faux, a population of virtual agents and households was generated such that the sociodemographic attributes of these virtual entities are spatially distributed in accordance with real-world census data (see Figure 3). In order to provide realistic distributions of household and individual attributes for Sioux Faux, we expanded publicly-available survey data for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. <br>

You have access to two sample populations with which you can run simulations:
* a 1,000 (1k) individuals sample
* a 15,000 (15k) individuals sample
