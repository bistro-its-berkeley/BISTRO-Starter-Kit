# The Sioux Faux Benchmark Scenario

In the Sioux Faux Benchmark Scenario, you may optimize the transportation network for a *sample of citizens* from a mock city: Sioux Faux. The cityâ€™s 157,000 citizens travel between activities using either their personal automobiles, buses provided via a public transit system, taxis enabled via an on-demand carsharing company, active modes such as walking, or a combination of multiple modes in accordance with their preferences. You will compete with other contestants to produce the best transportation outcomes as computed by the [scoring function](./Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md).

## Sioux Faux network
The Sioux Faux road network is shown below (Fig. 1). The twelve bus routes operated by the Sioux Faux Bus Lines (SFBL) transportation company are simulated in the Benchmark Scenario.

## Sioux Faux sample population

In order to simulate the activity and travel behavior of the citizens of Sioux Faux, a population of virtual agents and households was generated such that the sociodemographic attributes of these virtual entities are spatially distributed in accordance with real-world census data (see Figure 3). In order to provide realistic distributions of household and individual attributes for Sioux Faux, we expanded publicly-available survey data for the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. <br>

You have access to two sample populations with which you can run simulations:
* a 1,000 (1k) individuals sample
* a 15,000 (15k) individuals sample
