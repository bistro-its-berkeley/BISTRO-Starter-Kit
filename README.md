# Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit

This is a starter-kit Repo for the **Uber Prize challenge** on **Crowd AI**. 

In this repo you will find background material, sample files and support scripts that help you to get started with the challenge.

## How do I get started?

Before you can get started, some explanations on the challenge are needed. Even if you will not have to deal with complex transit analysis (the BEAM simulator will do it for you!), understanding a few transportation concepts and the general working of the simulator will help you to grasp the framework of the challenge. 

Read:
  * **Introduction to the Urban Transportation Optimization Problem** First, read the quick [introduction on the Urban Transportation Optimization problem](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Introduction_transportation_problem.md). It will give you a general understanding of the problem you need to solve and the related optimization challenges. 

  * **The Problem statement of the Hackathon** Presentation of the Sioux-Faux case
  
  * **The inputs to optimize** [link](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Which-inputs-should-I-optimize%3F.md)
  
  * **The outputs description** [link](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md)
  
  * **The tutorial on how to run a simulation** [link](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/How_to_run_a_simulation%3F.md)
  
  * **How to submit?** [link](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/What_and_how_to_submit)
