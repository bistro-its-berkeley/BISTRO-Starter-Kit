# Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit

This is a starter-kit Repository for the **Uber Prize challenge** on **Crowd AI**. 

In this repo you will find background materials that will help you get started with the challenge. 

## Competition Phasing
The competition will be split into two phases, preceded by a Hackathon... **Flesh this out**

## How do I get started?

Before you can get started, some explanations on the challenge are needed. Even though you will not have to deal with complex transit analysis (the BEAM simulator will do it for you!), understanding a few transportation concepts and the general framework of the simulator will help you to grasp the framework of the challenge. 

We recommend that you proceed through the documentation in the following order:

  * **Introduction to the Transportation Systems Challenge Framework**: First, read the quick [introduction on the Urban Transportation Optimization problem](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Introduction_transportation_problem.md). It will give you a general understanding of the framework of problem you need to solve and the related optimization challenges. 

  * **The Problem statement for the Hackathon**: Then, read through the [presentation of the Sioux-Faux case] for the Hackathon, which provides a high-level description of the tasks, as well as information on the outputs and scoring function. **LINK**
  
  * **The inputs to optimize**: Next, the [Which inputs should I optimize?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Which-inputs-should-I-optimize%3F.md) page will give you the steps for installing BEAM and understanding what the inputs of the simulation are, where they are stored, and how to modify them.
  
  * **The description of the outputs**: Once you're familiar with the inputs, read the [Understanding the outputs and the scoring function](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md) page to get a better understanding of the outputs of the simulation, where they are stored after a simulation run, what they describe, and how to interpret them. Here you will also find details on how the outputs are used to construct the challenge scoring function.
  
  * **The tutorial on how to run a simulation**: Once you are clear about the inputs you can manipulate, the outputs, and the effects of changes in inputs on the outputs, the [How to run a simulation?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/How_to_run_a_simulation%3F.md) page will explain the steps to run a simulation.
  
  * **How to submit?** To finish, follow the [How to submit?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/What_and_how_to_submit%3F.md) instructions to submit your solution.
  

## What do I have to do?

Your will generate a set of inputs (where a set of inputs can be thought of as a policy--find more on this in the **Problem Statement** to optimize the transportation system of Sioux Faux, based upon the criteria given in the Problem Statement. Solutions will be judged using the scoring function, and your goal is to achieve the **highest score**. In the event of ties, solutions will be judged on **[X,Y,Z] (the explanation, potentially?)** and a winner will be determined.

Once you have a solution, you should submit:
* your **best outputs (.zip)**
* a **brief explanation on your methodology (.doc)**: For example: how did you solve the optimization problem? What was the motivation behind your approach? What did you try? What failed? Is there some room for improvement?
* any comments on this starter kit repository (as pull requests) if you see any unclear information or have any suggestions for improvements.

For info on how to submit, read this [tutorial](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/What_and_how_to_submit%3F.md).
