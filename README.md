# Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit

This is a starter-kit Repository for the **Uber Prize challenge** on **Crowd AI**. 

In this repo you will find background material that help you to get started with the challenge. 

## How do I get started?

Before you can get started, some explanations on the challenge are needed. Even if you will not have to deal with complex transit analysis (the BEAM simulator will do it for you!), understanding a few transportation concepts and the general working of the simulator will help you to grasp the framework of the challenge. 

We recommend that you proceed through the documentation in the following order:

  * **Introduction to the Transportation Systems Challenge Framework**: First, read the quick [introduction on the Urban Transportation Optimization problem](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Introduction_transportation_problem.md). It will give you a general understanding of the framework of problem you need to solve and the related optimization challenges. 

  * **The Problem statement of the Hackathon**: Presentation of the Sioux-Faux case for the Hackhaton. **LINK**
  
  * **The inputs to optimize**: The [Which inputs should I optimize?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit-/blob/master/docs/Which-inputs-should-I-optimize%3F.md) page will give you the steps for installing BEAM and understanding what the inputs of the simulation are, where they are stored and how to modify them. 
  
  * **The outputs description**: Then, read the [Understanding the outputs and the scoring function](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/Understanding_the_outputs_and_the%20scoring_function.md) page to get a better understanding of the outputs of the simulation, where they are stored after a simulation run, what do they describe and how to interpret them. 
  
  * **The tutorial on how to run a simulation**: Once you are clear about the inputs/outputs you can manipulate, this [How to run a simulation?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/How_to_run_a_simulation%3F.md) page will explain the steps to run a simulation.
  
  * **How to submit?** To finish with, follow the [How to submit?](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/What_and_how_to_submit%3F.md) to submit your solution.
  

## What do I have to do?

You must try to generate the best policy related-inputs combination to optimize the transportation system of Sioux Faux.
The goal is to find a solution with the **greater score as possible**.

Once you have a solution, you should submit:
* your **best outputs (.zip)**
* a **brief explanation on your methodology (.doc)**: how did you solve the optimization problem?, what did you try?, is there some room for improvement?
* some comments on this starter kit repository (pull requests) if you see any unclear information or have any suggestions for improvements.

For info on how to submit, read this [tutorial](https://github.com/vgolfier/Uber-Prize-Starter-Kit/blob/master/docs/What_and_how_to_submit%3F.md).
