## Contributing to the Uber Prize Starter Kit

The core development team and maintainers are always grateful to users looking to improve this starter kit. In order to equitably, expeditiously, and courteously resolve issues as well as collaborate on improvements to the code base, we ask that you adhere to the guidelines below.

<!--TODO: Code of conduct?-->


0. **Important:** Please search issues to determine whether your bug or feature already exists or has been closed. If extant and stale, consider adding a üëç in the comment thread to indicate that core developers may wish to re-prioritize their work queue.

1. Open a new issue. Provide a succinct, descriptive title, the appropriate milestone, and useful labels according to the type of issue.

- Bug reports should engage with code owner towards collaborative problem-solving. Effective bug reports "_show, don't tell_" by minimally providing the following info: What did you do (relevant execution context such as hardware, OS, input params, other config settings)? What happened (include, in particular, any relevant console outputs, stack traces, erroneous output samples, etc. ).? What did you expect (description of "happy path" that will indicate bug resolution)? 
- For feature requests, please provide a minimal summary of the proposed feature; preferably w/ a use case. Effective feature requests also describe a problem that requires improvement of the current code base and propose a possible solution to the problem. Pull requests (PRs, conventions described below)  should implement this solution.  Note that alternative solutions may be proposed by core developers. You may find that conversation leads to a better solution, so please feel free to engage collaboratively with core devs.

2. Create a feature branch referencing the issue in its name according to the following template: `<initials>/#<issue-number>-<issue_description_in_lower_snake_case>`.
